budgets
========

On Monday 8th, this project has taken a boost to become part of my portafolio. 

# IDEA 
The idea of this project is to provide a SPA to control budgets on companies, this idea happened to me while working as IT responsible I 
needed to provide weekly budgets to be authorized by CFO on the company I was working for. I realized that the current way of working 
through email while sending 3 option budgets to pick one was ok for small ammounts of goods / services, it was quite confusing when having to 
deal with several daily purchases, the worse case was the hit that the CFO is taking by several departments doing the very same thing. 

# DEVELOPING

This application it's being developed in a chromeOS stack provided with just 2gb of ram and a arm cortex, using vim as an IDE with all kinds 
of plugin allowing me to snatch at every kb of memory available, of course it is chrooted with debian Jessie and just cli, a samsung SD card of 32gb 
and a senheiser hd 202 refurbished by myself headphones, It all costs about 110 usd all used, what I am trying to set here it's that while It's 
very nice to have a mac ( I do also ) it's not imposible to make working applications with much more less.

# LOGO

# Technology 

Since I wanted to try new stuff and investigate further regarding SPA and not taking the usual Angular 2 path, I decided to give it a try at VUE, so the technology list is:

  * VueJS 2
  * Axios ( for making rest calls in Vue ) 
  * PHP 7 ( Why keep using 5.x if it is deprecated all ready )
  * MongoDB ( I do not have any time to waste on entity relation modelling )
  * Bootstrap ( It can provide easy to use Icons and buttons )

# INSTALLATION 

Just run 
    vagrant up 


# INSPIRATION NOTE

I realized that developing your own applications can always take a lot more of effort than working on assigned measured tasks / applications, 
this has to do with the fact of uncertainity that lies on not knowing if your application can solve anybody else's problem, if it is worth doing 
it or getting that self motivation shot, that's why I want to mention that if you feel that way you can always make use of music, this is why 
I want to mention my favorite rock band Candy66, sounds crazy, but, for me, every piece of software has its own song, https://open.spotify.com/album/2E56yLT82ZtDU7q4zDk1OJ
